# ElOscuro

*ElOscuro* aims to be a classic and refined *Rise of the Triad* source port.

This port does not aim at historical accuracy, but keeps the original look and feel, while adding some quality of life features. The mains focus is to produce a simple and quick to use source port, and fix bugs as well as modernizing the codebase.

## Actual difference from other source ports

As I'm working on this port alone, progress takes a lot of time. Pull requests are **greatly** appreciated. If you want to help, you can work on the following tasks:

* Restauring network multiplayer
* Uncapping the framerate
* Rewriting the mouse and keyboard routines
* Getting rid of useless casting
* Cleaning away outdated programming practice
* Removing dead and useless code
* Fixing compilation warnings
* Any other ideas are welcome

## Requirements

You will need libADLMIDI in order to be able to compile this port.

## Game files

As for now, this source port contains all the available version of *Rise of the Triad*. However, it may be possible that only the code for the “Site Licence” will be kept.
